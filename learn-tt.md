*I've been trying to write a blog post to this effect for a while now,
 hopefully this one will stick. I intend for this to be a bit more
 open-ended than most of my other posts, if you're interested in
 seeing the updated version look [here][github]. Pull requests/issues
 are more than welcome on the repository. I hope you learn something
 from this*
